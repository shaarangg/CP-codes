# Dynamic Programing Problems
Problems in DP can be divided into 10 categories given below.
<br>

# 0-1 Knapsack
Knapsack is a bag which can contain items.<br>In this category of problem we're given a total capacity or weight W and n-items which have their own capacity w<sub>i</sub> and have their own value v<sub>i</sub> and we need to find a subset of items whose total weight is <=W and whose value is either maximum or minimum out of all possible solutions.

# Unbounded Knapsack
Whole conecpt remains the same as in 0-1 Knapsack the only change is you can add multiple instances of an item.

# Tip
The best way to find the recursive solution is:
1. Find the base condition.(To find the base condition thinks of the smallest valid input and code the answer to that input.)
2. Make the choice diagram and code the choice diagram.
