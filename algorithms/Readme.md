# Sieve of Eratosthenes
It is an O(N*log(log(N))) technique to find all the prime-numbers uptill N. We initialize an array 0 uptill N and then mark all the multiples of prime numbers as non-prime.
The loop runs N/2 + N/3 + N/5 .... P. This is equal to log(logN). Hence the time-complexity = O(N*log(log(n)))

# Sieve Prime factorisation
It is an modified technique of Sieve of Eratosthenes prime factorising a given number.
